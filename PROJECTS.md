## Projects I would like to work on:
1. RL2.ModLoader.Website.DiscordBot
    - A Discord bot for adding and updating mods in the database
2. Taconversion
    - A Terraria total conversion mod with Monster Hunter inspired mechanics
3. RL2.ModLoader.Launcher
    - A launcher for RL2.ModLoader, providing a UI for enabling/disabling mods, launching the game, searching for mods. This would allow users to play vanilla RL2 without much hassle


## Projects I would like to return to:
1. RL2.ModLoader.Website.DatabaseQuery
    - Rework the database layout to be more sane
2. RL2.ModLoader.Website
    - Don't load all mods into one page.
    - Add tags
    - Improve layout 
3. ReforgeQTE
    - Implement the QTE, thus finishing the mod
